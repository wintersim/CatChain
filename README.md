# CatChain- W.I.P.

#### A simple Blockchain approach for storing pictures of cats

## Features list (not yet completed)

* Allow users to store pictures of cats permanently on the Blockchain
* A miner that uses AI to confirm that the uploaded picture is a cat
* tbd


## What CatChain is not supposed to be

* A Cryptocurrency with a real world value


## Possible issues when making this software public

* People sending pictures that clearly show no cats on it (**cough** Pedos **cough**)

## Why cats

I just want to make my own blockchain for learning purposes. Storing pictures of cats is the first thing that came to my mind :)
