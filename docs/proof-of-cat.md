# Proof of cat

Securing the network by sending funny cat pictures to those who contribute

### How it works

* Instead of giving miners a coin/toking with a real world value, we give them a picture of a cat
* Miners can decide if a picture is good and can be stored on the blockchain
* The more people 'mine' the more secure the network becomes, since there are more people to decide
* If the network suffers from a 51% attack, the attackers can chose what type of images they want to store on the blockchain

ok we need some more thoughts here

#### Quick thoughts/alternate ways
* By successfully mining a coin (more than 51% chose the same answer) you get the right to send one picture to the blockchain yourself
