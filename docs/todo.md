#### CatChain TODO list and much more


##### TODO

* Mining
* Adaptive Difficulty
* Networking
* Adding pictures to blockchain
* Cat AI


##### Thoughts

* When successfully mining a block ('All pictures are indeed cats') all pictures hashed together create the block-hash
* But we still use classic nonce thingy to secure the Blockchain (TODO only use cat validator AI to create immutable blockchain)
* We use SHA-512 instead of SHA-256 to be (somewhat) quantum proof TM
* Maybe we let the users 'mine' themselves 
    * The miner-software shows transactions i.e. pictures and the user has to decide whether the picture is worth to be stored permanently in the blockchain
    
* When a new block is available to be mined miners have 60 seconds to decide
    * Scalability?
