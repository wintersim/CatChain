#### CatChain TODO list and much more


##### TODO

* ~~Mining~~
* Adaptive Difficulty
* Networking
* Adding pictures to blockchain
* Cat AI
* Implement exceptions
* Remove Exif Data from Images

##### Thoughts

* We use the usual mining method to secure the Blockchain (TODO also use cat validator AI to create immutable blockchain)
* Each block contains one image of a cat

* ~~Maybe we let the users 'mine' themselves~~ 
    * ~~The miner-software shows transactions i.e. pictures and the user has to decide whether the picture is worth to be stored permanently in the blockchain~~
    
* ~~When a new block is available to be mined miners have 60 seconds to decide~~
    * Scalability?
* Letting users decide is a difficult task    

* By Mining a block (Providing CPU Power) users gain the right to send a picture to the blockchain
